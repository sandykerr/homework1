What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge updates the current branch to include the changes in the branch specified in "git merge <branch>". A rebase changes the origin of the current branch to be the end of the branch specified in "git rebase <branch>".

What is a remote repository?

It's an online version of a collection of files that allows for collaboration (writing to and pulling from).
